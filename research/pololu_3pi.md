## Usage

### On board Components
#### IR Sensors
The 3pi robot includes five infrared sensors for line following and obstacle detection. These sensors are connected to the microcontroller's ADC pins, allowing for analog readings of reflected IR light intensity.

### Buzzer
The onboard buzzer can be controlled via a digital pin to produce sound for alerts or feedback.

### Buttons
The 3pi robot has three user buttons connected to specific digital pins, allowing for user input and interaction with the robot's programs.

### Powering Up

The 3pi robot is powered by four AA batteries. Ensure correct installation and sufficient charge. An onboard voltage regulator manages power distribution.

### Programming

Program the 3pi robot using the Arduino IDE. See the [Pololu 3pi Robot User‚Äôs Guide](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J21/) for setup instructions.

### Expansion

A 2x7 header exposes several I/O pins for expansion (sensors, actuators, etc.). See the user guide for detailed pinout.
