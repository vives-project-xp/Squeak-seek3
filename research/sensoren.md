# IR Sensors
The 3pi robot includes five infrared sensors by default for line following and obstacle detection. These sensors are connected to the microcontroller's ADC pins, allowing for analog readings of reflected IR light intensity.
Adding more can be useful for more complex tasks. For example, turning info (t-junctions, intersections, ...) or detecting objects.
